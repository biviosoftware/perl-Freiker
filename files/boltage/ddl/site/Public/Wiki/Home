Freiker is performance-based charity.  At right you can see our
results in real-time.  The ridership numbers are automatically
collected and transmitted to this site by a ^Freikometer.

The ^Freikometer is one secret to our success, and the other is our
^Prizes.  Every kid can win an iPod.  

@h3 Testimonials

I love seeing the happy, steady parade of kids going by my house,
and the families all having morning bike together time.
That's really a great and sweet benefit.

I think this is SUCH a great idea.  It's something that will
potentially lower the crowding at pickup/drop off, it will encourage
helmet wearing and it is good exercise for the kids.

a story and link to it on my website.
