Freiker, Inc., a Colorado non-profit corporation, (
@strong "Freiker," "we,"
or 
@strong "us"
) provides the Freiker site at URL: 
^http://www.Freiker.org/ 
("Site").  The Site offers access to various Freiker information and services, including without limitation the ability to register a child for participation in the Program, as defined below (collectively, the 
@strong "Services"
), to our users, whether they be students, parents, educators, or other visitors to the Site under the terms of service and use contained in this document.  
@strong "You" 
means the individual person entering this Site on his or her own behalf, or, on behalf of his or her minor child, in which case the person entering this Agreement represents and warrants that he or she has the authority to do so on the minor’s behalf.  Any minor child on whose behalf you are accessing the Site, including registering the minor child to be a participant in the Freiker Program, is referred to as a 
@strong "Child."

These Freiker Terms of Service and Use, along with Freiker’s Privacy Policy, located at 
^http://www.Freiker.org/bp/Privacy_Policy
("Privacy Policy"), set forth the legally binding terms of your access to and use of the Site and the Services ("Terms").  

Please read the Terms carefully.  You understand and agree that these terms set forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Site and Services and participation in the Program, and the Services and participation in the Program are provided to you exclusively under these Terms. 
@strong By accessing or using the Site or Services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the Terms.  
If you do not agree with these Terms, you should leave the Site and discontinue use of the Services immediately.  If you wish to register to make use of the Services reserved for participants, such as the Program, you must read these Terms and indicate your acceptance during the registration process, after which time you will become a "Freiker Participant".  Note, however, that these Terms apply to your access to and use of the Site and Services regardless of whether you are a Freiker Participant.  We reserve the right to terminate your use or access to the Site or Services at any time for any reason, including, without limitation, if we learn that you have provided false or misleading information or have violated the Terms.

@strong 1.	FREIKER ACCOUNT

_Registering._
Depending on what Services you desire to receive, and whether or not you want to participate in the Program, you may need to register and become a Freiker Participant.  You will find registration instructions on the Freiker Site.  Freiker may accept or reject your registration in Freiker’s sole discretion.

You acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely liable for all activities with respect to the use of the Service by any other individual who accesses the Service through your account, including without limitation a Child.

You agree not to use the Freiker profile, username, password, or RFID chip of another Freiker Participant at any time unless authorized by such Freiker Participant. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your Freiker profile or RFID chip, or access to your password.

@strong 2.	SERVICES
Freiker will provide you the Services chosen by you on the Site substantially as described in the Terms and on the Freiker Site.  The Services are made available for your personal, internal, non-commercial use.  You may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, re-sell, distribute, or otherwise exploit the Services, the Site, or our Content (as defined below).  You may not frame our Content, or make available, or facilitate distribution of our Content through any means or medium.

@strong 3.	THE FREIKER PROGRAM

Freiker offers a collection of services and offerings, including an incentive based program which encourages children to ride their bikes or use other non-mechanized forms of transport to school (such as walking or skateboarding) in a lawful and safe manner, which is described in more detail elsewhere on the Site (collectively, the 
@strong "Program").
To participate in the Program, you must register the Child on the Site to become a Freiker Participant and abide by (and ensure the Child abides by) the terms and conditions contained in these Terms.  

It is your responsibility to pick up the Freiker RFID tag that will allow your Child to fully participate in the Program ("Tag") from you Child’s school.  You can find more information about obtaining the Tag elsewhere on the Site or by contacting your Child’s school directly.  

To participate in the Program, the Child need only ride his or her bike (or take such other non-mechanized transport as may be allowed by your Child’s school) to school, locate the "Freikometer" (the device that reads and records the presence of the Tag), and the Freikometer will log that the Child took a form of non-mechanized transport to school on that day. You acknowledge and agree that the Freikometer will send certain information to Freiker for analysis and use in accordance with these Terms and the Privacy Policy. From time to time and in Freiker’s discretion, Freiker or your Child’s school or sponsors of the program at your Child’s school may provide incentives, including prizes, to children who participate in the Program.  Freiker does not guarantee that any particular child, including the Child, will receive a prize.  Information about prizes is contained elsewhere on the Site.
You, or if you grant the Child permission, the Child, may access the Site and follow the Child’s progress in the Program.

@strong 4.	YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

You must not use the Site or Services to, and must prevent any Child from using the Site or Services to: (a) violate any local, state, national or international law; (b) stalk, harass or harm another individual; (c) collect or store personal data about other users; (d) impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity; or (e) interfere with or disrupt the Site or Services or servers or networks connected to the Site or Services, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the Site or Services.
