@h1 Help Freiker keep pedaling in 2009

2008 has been a terrific year for Freiker!  We added four new schools (including our first out-of-state school), more than doubling the number of participants from last year.  We also expanded our program to count walkers as well as cyclists, hired our first part-time staff person, and received excellent press coverage.  Our growth and success would not be possible without the generous financial support and excitement of our donors and volunteers. 


Please help us continue to grow 
@a href=^/bp/Support_Freiker by making a year-end donation to Freiker@
.
With your support, Freiker will get even more kids riding and walking to school.  Not only will those children be getting daily exercise, but they will be helping the environment and will be more alert and confident.  And best of all, they will be having fun the whole time!  

Here's how 
@a href=^/bp/Support_Freiker your tax-deductible donation 
will help us:

@ul
@li $50 covers the cost of tags for 50 children
@li $150 keeps the Freiker program going at a school for one month
@li $2000 covers the cost of a Freikometer  
@/ul

Many thanks and happy holidays!  Keep those feet and pedals moving!
