@h2 Support Healthier Kids
@p
The national exercise guidelines call for  elementary school-age children to engage in physical activity for 150 minutes  each week; older children for 225 minutes. By biking to school, children go a  long way towards meeting the guidelines and adopting behaviors that are part of  a healthy lifestyle. Support a bike-to-school program and support the health of  Americas  children.

@h2 Support A Healthier Planet
@p
Freikers take a  stand against global warming by utilizing a sustainable mode of transportation.  Although a quick drive to school may seem innocuous, the cumulative effect is  significant. A single gallon of gasoline produces more than 19 pounds of  carbon dioxide.
