@strong Freiker (FREquent bIKER, rhymes with biker)
 believes that every bike ride counts as:
						  
						  
@ul
							
@li
@strong healthy
 - fun and exercise with friends and family
@/li
							
@li
@strong environmentally friendly
 - one less car on the road
@/li
							
@li
@strong easy
 - the perfect way to get to school
@/li
						  
@/ul
						  
@p
							Kids do the pedaling, our "^Freikometer" does the counting.  
							Rides add up throughout the school year and are redeemed for prizes at an end-of-year school party.  It's that simple.
						  
@/p
						  
						  
@p
							Join the movement that's inspiring kids to change our schools, our communities and our world - one bike ride 
							at a time.
