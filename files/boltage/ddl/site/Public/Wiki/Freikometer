Like many other bike encouragement programs, Freiker started with
punch cards.  The next year we used barcodes and scanners.  In 2006,
we debuted the Freikometer: an automatic device that counts riders and
uploads the data securely to this site.  It's solar powered so you can
put it right near the bike racks at your school.  This has allowed
us to expand rapidly without compromising the quality of our data.

The Freikometer is currently being used at five
@a href=http://www.bvsd.org Boulder Valley School District
schools.  The Freikometers survived (for the most part) the harsh
winter of 2006-2007.  We completely redesigned the Freikometers for
the 2007-2008 school year, and they are working better than ever.

@h3 Helmets are a must

The Freikometer counts riders using a radio-frequency identification
(RFID).  Freikers have RFID tags affixed to their helmets.  When they
ride to school, they ride past the Freikometer to "ring in".

This means that all participants have to wear helmets.  You can't ring
in without your helmet.  And, it's easiest to be wearing the helmet as
you ride by the Freikometer.

@h3 Performance-driven

Freiker's success is measurable due to fanatical dedication to data.
We want to know that what we are doing is making a difference.

Freiker started at 
@a href=http://schools.bvsd.org/crestview Crest View Elementary
in March 2005.  Crest View was a fairly active school with about
12,000 rides per year.  In 2007-2008 we are likely to surpass 24,000
rides.  You can see these results in the graph below.
