@h1 Wheels roll around

Wheels are our main contact with schools in our program.  We provide you
with RFID tags.  

The friekometer uploads the rides daily.  The software takes care of the rest.  You also have to hand out the
Green Gears, but that's a lot of fun.  Nothing like being in a sea
of smiling faces.
