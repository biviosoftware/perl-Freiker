@h1 Prizes

@p
Everybody can win a prize.  Freiker is *not*a*competition* - prizes are earned based on the number of times a child rides to school, and every child who rides can earn a prize.  At the end of the year, kids trade in accumulated rides for a prize - the more times theyâ€™ve ridden, the better the prize.

There are two components to the Freiker prize program:
@ul
@li
*Weekly*prize* - The Green Gear (a medal made of a green bike gear) and $10 in cash is given to one child per school each week.  The winner is randomly selected from the pool of Freikers who rode every day the prior week.  The Green Gear program encourages kids to &quote;complete the week&quote; and provides an opportunity to win a meaningful prize to kids who may not ride enough to earn a premium prize under the program.
 
@li
*Prizes*for*rides* - A Freiker earns prizes based on the number of days he or she rides over the course of a school year.  Think of it like a frequent flier program but with bikes - the more you rider, the better the prize.

Remember, Freikers do not compete against each other for prizes.  There is no best in class or school.
@strong
Every Freiker wins if he or she rides.

Ride to school once, and you're a Freiker.  Ride to school for an entire week, and you are entered into a drawing to win the Green Gear and $10.  Ride to school throughout the year and earn a premium prize.  These are achievable goals for any child, and they represent the first step towards a healthier, more self-reliant, more alert student.  

@p
Each school determines the prizes it will offer and the number of rides to earn each prize. Please contact the volunteer at your school to see the available prizes at your school.
