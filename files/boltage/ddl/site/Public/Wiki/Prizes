We have a great variety of prizes.  All prizes except the
@span class=prize_rides Green Gear
 are deducted from your ride
total.  We are working on prize management system, which will
show how many rides you may apply to prizes.  Prizes
will be ordered via your Family's account on this website.

Every Monday (or the first school day in the week), we award the Green Gear
to the top Freiker of the Week.  If several Freikers are tied, we choose one
at random.  The Freiker of the Week also wins $10.  Yes, TEN DOLLARS, just for
riding your bike to school every day the prior week.  This is an extra prize.
You get to use those same rides for any of the ride prizes below.  Special
thanks to 
@a href=http://www.resourcerevival.com Resource Revival, Inc.
for supplying the gears and to
the 
@a href=http://www.boulderbumpshop.com Boulder Bump Shop
 for painting
them.

An iPod!  This is the piece de resistance for kids nowadays.  If you ride
90% of the year to school, you'll win one.  It's that simple -- well, not
really, but there are plenty of other prizes below.  This is just the
one everybody seems to want.  At Crest View, you have to ride
@span class=prize_rides 160 times
, but schools which start Freiker part of the way
through the year will use a lower number of rides (90% of possible rides
during the partial year).
