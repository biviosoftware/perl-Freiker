The Freiker Program encourages kids to ride their bikes to school.  The
program is
@a href=/hm/wheels run by volunteers
and supported with
@a href=/hm/sponsors donations from sponsors
as
well as parents.  
@a href=/hm/donate Please donate to Freiker!

@h3 RFID tags

To participate in the program, your child's helmet is marked with an
Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) tag by a Freiker volunteer.
Every day your child must ride by the Freikometer
to be counted.  The Freikometer runs before and after school so if you are
late to school or are an afternoon kindergartner, don't worry, you'll be
counted.  The RFID tag does not identify your child.  This
is to help ensure you and your child's privacy.  The code is unique, which is
how our software knows your child has ridden that day.  We 
@b do not require
any information that would identify your child.

@h3 Prizes

Everybody can 
@a href=/hm/prizes win a prize@
.  Freiker is not a
competition between children, classes, or schools.  After ten rides, every
Freiker (program participant) is eligible for a prize.  At the end of the
year, there's a party for all Freikers, even if you have only ridden to
school one time!  You just need your Freiker helmet tag to get in.

Every Monday one child wins an extra prize called the
Green Gear along with $10 cash.  To be eligible for the Green Gear, a
child must ride every school day the prior week.  The Green Gear is
selected randomly from the children who rode the entire week.

@a href=/pub/register Parents must register
with this website.
There's no charge, and we only require an email address, which allows
us to contact you when your child wins a prize.

@h3 Rides

Your child must ride by the Freikometer in the morning or afternoon.  We
do our best to instruct your child, but it's up to parents to make sure
that they follow through.  Some small children need to be reminded, but
older kids get it right away.

Sometimes the Freikometer is broken, or it doesn't read an RFID tag properly.
In this case, you can login to the website and click on
the Add Missing Ride link.

@h3 Cheating

Each school's 
@a href=/hm/wheels Wheels
decide what is cheating.  Some
schools include scooters.  Others don't allow them.  With an iPod at
stake, cheating is inevitable.  If your child is caught checking in with
the Freikometer, and she hasn't ridden to school that day, she will lose
all her rides up to that point.  Wheels audit from time to time, and it's
up to you to not let your child checkin without riding.  This is a guideline,
and you need to talk to your school's Wheels about what is and isn't allowed.

@h3 Safety

We are concerned about your child's safety.  Riding to school is a lot of fun,
and it is very safe.  The more kids that ride together, the more likely they
are to be seen.  Freiker encourages kids to ride safely.  We will supply
helmets to children who need and cannot afford them.  Your child must wear
a helmet to participate in the program.

@b Parents are responsible for their child's safety.
Please teach your children about road safety.
We recommend you ride with your child until you are satisfied
your child can ride alone. There are many excellent resources that help
you understand bike safety, for example,

@h3 Photos

From time to time, we may take photographs of your child.  We may
put your child's picture on our website, in a brochure, or other
printed materials to show how much fun Freiker is.  If you do not
want your child's picture published, please contact us at

to maintain your family's privacy.

@h3 Volunteers

Your help would be greatly appreciated.  If you already have
a 
@a href=/hm/wheels wheel (lead volunteer)

go to your bike rack on a Monday morning.  If you would like to bring
Freiker to your school, please contact us at

inclined, please go to school board and/or city council meetings and
tell them about Freiker.  If you know how to write grants, we could
use your help, too.
