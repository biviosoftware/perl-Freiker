<h3>Who's a Freiker?</h3>
<p>
A freiker is someone who rides a bike to school.  You can be a
freiker, too.  Lots of people ride bikes to school all over the world.
It's a lot of fun.  All you have to do is try it once to see how much
fun it can be.
</p>
<p>
<span class="new_site"><a href="/">Click here to visit our current site.</a></span><br/>
Some people don't own a bike.  Lots of bike shops sell used bikes.
You can probably find a used bike for less than $100 in the US.  If
you don't have $100 for a bike, ask a freiker volunteer for help.
We'll find you a bike.
</p>
<p>
If you live too far away from school, ask your parents if you can bike
part of the way to school.  The fewer
cars there are right around the school, the safer it is for freikers
coming to school.  People driving their kids to school sometimes are
in such hurry that they don't notice pedestrians or freikers.  When
your parents drop you off outside the school zone and let you ride the rest
of the way to school, they'll be less rushed, and you'll win
prizes like the other kids, too.  Woops! I gave that part away!
</p>
<h3>What's a Freiker Card?</h3>
<p class="no-indent">
<img id="card" alt="freiker card" src="i/card.jpg" width="210" height="150">
A freiker card lets freikers know how many times they've ridden to
school.  Each time someone rides to school, a freiker volunteer at the
bike racks punches your card in one of the freiker
wheels (the green circles).
</p>
<p>
<span class="new_site"><a href="/">Click here to visit our current site.</a></span><br/>
After all 10 freiker wheels on your freiker card are punched, you turn
your card in to get a prize.  Your class also gets a punched
<img src="i/punched_wheel.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="punched_wheel">
freiker wheel.  The classes in each grade with the most freiker wheels
at the end of the year get a special prize.  We also give prizes to
the kids who've ridden the most in each grade and for the whole school.
</p>
<p>
<a href="crestview.html">The final totals for 2005 are posted on
this site so you can see how well your class did.</a>
</p>
<p>
Freiker cards are numbered, and we write down your name (and class)
along with the number.  We'll also write your name on the back.  This
lets us help you out in case you lose it, or you eat it for a snack.
Don't try this unless you are <i>really</i> hungry, ok?
</p>
<h3>Who are the Freiker Volunteers?</h3>
<p>
<span class="new_site"><a href="/">Click here to visit our current site.</a></span><br/>
Freiker volunteers are people who think kids need to learn that bike
riding is a practical and fun way to get around.  Most kids won't
start riding to school without an incentive.  That's why we made up
the freiker program.  It's how we hope to encourage kids to learn that
bike riding is a great way to get to school, and, later in life, a
pleasant way to start your work day.  You can reach us at <span
class="email">card<img src="i/at.gif" alt="at sign" width="15"
height="15">freiker.org</span>, and we'll be happy to answer any
questions you might have.  And, yes, we'd be ecstatic if you'd like to
lend a hand.

<h3><a href="sponsor.html">Who are the Freiker Sponsors?</a></h3>
<p>
<span class="new_site"><a href="/">Click here to visit our current site.</a></span><br/>
<a href="http://www.bivio.biz">bivio Software, Inc.</a> started
the freiker program at
<a href="http://www.bvsd.org/schools/crestview/index.html">Crest
View Elementary School</a>.
We are also supported by
<a href="sponsor.html">several local Boulder companies</a>.

<h3>What does the program cost?</h3>
<p>
<span class="new_site"><a href="/">Click here to visit our current site.</a></span><br/>
The freiker program cost us about $1.00 per freiker-day during the
three months of spring 2005.  This included the year-end parties and
t-shirts.  Deducting these one-time costs, we spent $.50 per
freiker-day.  We were experimenting with different prizes, which
didn't allow us to get volume discounts.  We hope to reduce the costs
to $.25 per freiker-day.
</p>
<h3>Does Freiker work?</h3>
<p>
<span class="new_site"><a href="/">Click here to visit our current site.</a></span><br/>
Freiker was started with the idea that we would have to buy another
bike rack at Crest View by the end of the year.  We met our goal.
There were more freikers than space for their bikes.
More importantly, the kids and
parents had a lot of fun.  (We'll get some pictures up soon!)
</p>
<p>
If you like statistics, then you will be interested in the
following graph, which compares the number of freikers on any given
day with the weather (temperature) on that day:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="i/crestview-weather-20050609.png" alt="Spring 2005 statistics" width="615" height="346">
</div>
<p>
The graph has been
<dfn title="using a 10 day exponential moving average (EMA), since you really wanted to know">smoothed out</dfn>
so you can see the trend more easily.  As you can see from the graph,
the number of freikers and the average temperature move together.
However, as we enter the merry month of May, the lines start to
approach each other.  In June, the number of riders crosses over the
temperature line ever so slightly.  That is, the weather
was less of a factor in determining whether (not weather) kids rode
their bikes to school in May and June.  It's likely that the freiker
program had an effect, and that's great!
