@h2 Registration
				
@p
Parents
				  must 
@a href=^/pub/register register
 in order for their children to participate  in the program.
				  It only takes a few  minutes. We need a valid email address  for registration (don't worry, we promise
				  we won't spam you, and we do not share  our email lists with anyone.), as well as your nine-digit zip code. This information
 				  will let us provide  additional data, such as calories burned and carbon emissions saved. Note
				  that the registration must be completed  by a parent or guardian, not a minor.

@h2 Log In
				
@p After  you have completed the registration process, and each time that you log in on  our website, you will be taken to the Your Family page. On that page, you can see how many rides your  child has and you can complete numerous administrative functions:
				
@ul
				  
@li
@a href=^/pub/register Register Child
-  Click on this function to register each of your children who is participating in the       Freiker program. You will need the number from your child's 
@a href=^Freikometer Freiker tag
 to add them to your account. Please       note that you cannot register a child until (1) he or she has gotten a 
@a href=^freikometer Freiker tag
, which he or she gets from the Freiker volunteer at school, and (2) the tag has been scanned by the       Freikometer at least one time. If       you have multiple children, please add all of them under the same account       and email address using the Register Child function for each child        please do not create a new account for each child. Also, please note that even if your       children have Freiker tags on their helmets, they are not official       participants in the Freiker program, and are not eligible to earn prizes,       until you have registered. Once you       have registered your child's tag, all of the rides for that tag will then       show up.

@strong Add Missing Rides -
  The  Freikometer only runs for a short period before school starts and when it lets  out. If your child is late to school or  if the Freikometer is malfunctioning on any given day, then you can use this  function to make sure that your child's ride gets counted for that day. 
@/li
				  
@li
@strong New Helmet Tag - 
  Your  child may lose his helmet or get a new helmet, or his or her tag may stop  functioning properly. In each case, he  or she will need to get a new tag from the Freiker volunteer. Use the New Helmet Tag function to add that  new tag to your child's account. If your  child is already participating in Freiker and you just need to register a new  tag, please do not use the Add Child function.

@/ul
				
@h2 Rides
				
@p Your child must ride by the Freikometer in  the morning or afternoon. We do our best to instruct your child, but it's up to  parents to make sure that they follow through. Some small children need to be  reminded, but older kids get it right away. 
				
@p Sometimes the Freikometer is broken, or it  doesn't read an RFID tag properly. In this case, you can login to the website  and click on the Add Missing Ride link. 
				
@h2 Safety
				
@p We are concerned about your child's safety.  Riding to school is a lot of fun, and it is very safe. The more kids that ride  together, the more likely they are to be seen. Freiker encourages kids to ride  safely. Your child must wear a helmet to participate in the program. 
				
@p
@strong
Parents  are responsible for their child's safety.
@/strong
 Please  teach your children about road safety. We recommend you ride with your child  until you are satisfied your child can ride alone. There are many excellent  resources that help you understand bike safety, for example,

@p Why  let the kids have all the fun? Provide  additional encouragement for your kids to ride by riding your bike to work,  around town and to and from school with your kids. Plus you'll be fitting exercise into your  busy schedule.
