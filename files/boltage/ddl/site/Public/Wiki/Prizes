@!Every Monday (or the first school day in the week), we award the 
@!@a href=^Green_Gear Green Gear
@!to the top Freiker of the Week.  If several Freikers are tied, we choose one
@!at random.  The Freiker of the Week also wins $10.  Yes, TEN DOLLARS, just for
@!riding your bike to school every day the prior week.  This is an extra prize.
@!You get to use those same rides for any of the ride prizes below.  Special
@!thanks to

An iPod!  This is the piece de resistance for kids nowadays.  If you ride
90% of the year to school, you'll win one.  It's that simple -- well, not
really, but there are plenty of other prizes below.  This is just the
one everybody seems to want.  At Crest View, you have to ride
@span.rides 160 times
, but schools which start Freiker part of the way
through the year will use a lower number of rides (90% of possible rides
during the partial year).
