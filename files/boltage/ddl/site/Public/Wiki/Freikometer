@p
Put simply, the Freikometer is the automatic device that counts riders and uploads the data securely to this site.  For those more technically inclined, the Freikometer is a solar-powered, eco-friendly radio frequency ID (RFID) tag reader that registers RFID tags placed in the kids’ helmets.
@p
The Freikometer counts the number of times a child rides to school, then wirelessly uploads the data to the Freiker website so children can see how close they are to earning a prize.  
@p
It’s that simple, and it sure beats using punch cards or surveys – believe us, we know from experience.

Some other benefits of the Freikometer
@ul
@li
*Automatic*counting* - The Freikometer automatically measures participation every day, rain or shine, with no need for volunteers to stand in the snow or heat, punching cards or hand-counting bikers and walkers.  Install it, hand out the tags and then forget about it.  
@li
*Daily*feedback* – The Freikometer rings each time that a kid rides under it, giving them daily feedback and a sense of accomplishment.  Seeing kids react to the Freikometer for the first time will absolutely bring a smile to your face!  
@li
*Solar-powered* - It’s solar powered so schools can put it right near the bike racks.  All we need is a wooden post to install it on.  
@li
*Data* - Freiker's success [Link: How It Works – Results] is measurable due to fanatical dedication to data.  With the date provided by the Freikometer and viewable on this website, schools can measure and evaluate the effect of Freiker.

@h2 RFID tags
@p
Tags provide the other component of our technology.  Each participating child will get an RFID tag on his or her helmet.  The tags contain a chip that is read by the Freikometer.
@p
The RFID tag has a unique code and number.  Parents enter this number as part of the registration process, so that their child gets credit for all of his or her rides.  We are very concerned about protecting the privacy of parents and their children, and the RFID tag does not contain any information that can be used to identify a child.
