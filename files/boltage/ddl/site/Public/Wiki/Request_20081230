@h1 Thank you for a stellar 2008

As this year rolls to a close, I wanted to thank all of our supporters for
making 2008 our most successful year ever.  We have seen unprecedented
participation levels at our schools, with schoolchildren logging 40,000
trips to and from school since the beginning of this school year.

@a href=^/bp/Support_Freiker Please make a year-end donation to Freiker
so that we can
help even more children discover the joys and
benefits of riding and walking to school.  Faegre & Benson, LLP has 
generously offered
to match donations that we receive before the end of the year.  
That's right -- thanks to
Faegre & Benson, your contribution will be doubled, but only if you
@a href=^/bp/Support_Freiker donate in the next two days@
.
