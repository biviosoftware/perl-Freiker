@h1 Prizes

Everybody can win a prize.  Freiker is *not*a*competition* - prizes are earned based on the number of times a child rides to school, and every child who rides can earn a prize.  At the end of the year, kids trade in accumulated rides for a prize - the more times they've ridden, the better the prize.

Remember, Freikers do not compete against each other for prizes.  There is no best in class or school.

Every Freiker wins if he or she rides.

Ride to school once, and you're a Freiker.  These are achievable goals for any child, and they represent the first step towards a healthier, more self-reliant, more alert student.

Each school determines the prizes it will offer and the number of rides to earn each prize. Please contact the volunteer at your school to see the available prizes at your school.
