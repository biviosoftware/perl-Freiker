@h1 How It Works
				
@img.fr_top_right src=^girl2.jpg
				
@p
*Freiker*  (short for *frequent*biker*
  rhymes with biker) is substantially
				  increasing the number of children regularly bicycling to
				  school.  Freiker uses advanced technology to count, and
				  provide incentives for kids who ride to school.

@strong Technology and Prizes  
@/p
				
@p
The ridership numbers
				  are 
@a href=FIXME automatically counted
 and sent
				  to this site by a 
@a href=FIXME Freikometer
.
				  The Freikometer is one secret to our success, and the other is
				  our 
@a href=FIXME prizes
.  Everybody can win a
				  prize.  Freiker is not a competition between children,
				  classes, or schools.  The combination of our two "secrets"
				  gets more kids on their bikes to school, more of the
				  time.  
@/p
				
@p
The 
@a href=FIXME Freikometer
 is a
				  solar-powered computer that reads
				  an 
@a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rfid RFID
 tag taped to riders' helmets. Each
				  day, a Freiker rides past the Freikometer, and a buzzer sounds
				  to indicate the ride has been logged. The Freikometer
				  wirelessly uploads the rider data to this website daily, and
				  the child or parent can log on to our website to see the
				  number of rides accumulated.  The Freikometer does the
				  counting, and the prizes provide the motivation.

@strong Benefits of the Freiker Program  
@/p
				
@p
Kids love tracking their progress, earning prizes and being
				  part of a movement.  But Freiker's appeal goes far beyond
				  the kids.  Parents also love the opportunity to get out on
				  their bikes to ride with their kids to and from school.  And
				  schools love seeing buses and cars replaced by a group of
				  parents and kids congregating around the bike racks.  
@/p
				
@p
And Freiker gets results.  Check out
				  our 
@a href=FIXME Results page
 to see how Freiker
				  has doubled ridership.

At Freiker, every ride counts.  Every ride:

@li
Promotes physical activity and combats childhood obesity:
					  The prevalence of overweight children and adolescents has
					  doubled over the past 20 years.  The U.S. Dept. of Health and
					  Human Services recommends that children engage in at least 60
					  minutes of moderate intensity physical activity most days of
					  the week, preferably daily, to promote health and
					  psychological well-being.  The trip to and from school is a
					  perfect way to meet that recommendation.
@/li
 
					
@li
Fosters self-reliance: Children gain confidence when they
					  don't have to rely on their parents or a bus to get them to
					  and from school.
@/li
  
					
@li
Increases alertness: Studies show that regular physical
					  activity results in more alert individuals and even promotes
					  brain activity.
@/li
					
@li
Reduces traffic congestion/better air quality:  More kids
					  on bikes means fewer cars on the road, and fewer cars idling
					  in front of the school in the mornings and afternoons.
@/li
					
@li
Promotes sense of community:  Many parents ride to school
					  with their children, and schools benefit from the impromptu
					  social gatherings that occur around the bike racks.
@/li
					
@li
Encourages helmet use.  Since the RFID tags are on the
					  helmets, children who ride without helmets aren't counted
					  by the Freikometer.
