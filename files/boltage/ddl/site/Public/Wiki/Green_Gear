Every Monday one child wins an extra prize called the Green Gear along with $10 cash. To be eligible for the Green Gear, a child must ride every school day the prior week. The Green Gear is selected randomly from the children who rode the entire week.

The Green Gear gives all kids a chance at winning a big
prize during the year.  We generally don't repeat winners
within a year unless all the kids who rode all days the
prior week have already one.
