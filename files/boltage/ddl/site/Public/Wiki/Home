@strong Freiker (FREquent bIKER, rhymes with biker)
 believes that every trip counts.  Biking or walking to school is:
						  
						  
@ul
							
@li
@strong healthy
 - fun and exercise with friends and family
@/li
							
@li
@strong environmentally friendly
 - one less car on the road
@/li
							
@li
@strong easy
 - the perfect way to get to school
@/li
						  
@/ul
						  
@p
							Kids do the walking or riding and our "Freikometer" does the counting.  
							Trips to school add up throughout the school year and are redeemed for prizes at an end-of-year school party.  It's that simple.
						  
@/p

							Join the movement that's inspiring kids to change their own health, our schools, our communities and our world - one trip to school 
							at a time.
